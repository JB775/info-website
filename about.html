			<h3>Where We Started</h3>
			<p>
			Eakins Oval is a traffic circle in Philadelphia. It forms the northwest end of the Benjamin Franklin Parkway just in front of the Philadelphia Museum of Art, with a central array of fountains and monuments, and a network of pedestrian walkways.</p>

			<h3>Where We're Located</h3>
			<p>The Oval, at Eakins Oval, is at the center of the Ben Franklin Parkway. 2451 Benjamin Franklin Parkway Philadelphia, PA 19130. There are crosswalks leading from the sidewalks of the Parkway, straight to the park. Please follow traffic signals.</p>

			<h3>What We Do</h3>
			<p>The pop-up was created as a three-year project in 2013 by a partnership of the Philadelphia Department of Parks and Recreation and the Fairmount Park Conservancy. The eight acres of public space located on the Benjamin Franklin Parkway known as Philadelphia’s own “Avenue des Champs-Élysées,” Eakins Oval (2451 Benjamin Franklin Parkway) became The Oval, a park with community programming, events and activities. Designed to promote the Parkway as a neighborhood park for all Philadelphians, The Oval offers a wide array of activities and amenities, and features park spaces that all ages can easily access and enjoy. Its success - about 70,000 people came to the park this summer - has sparked conversations about the spot's use year-round. With the shutdown of the pop-up, the oval will return to being a green space with a large fountain, and a venue for such events as the Made in America concert. It is our hope that the next city administration will at least bring back the summer oval pop-up. Unlike other pop-up gardens throughout the city that cater to the over-21 crowd, the oval has maintained a family atmosphere on its eight acres of turf across from the Art Museum steps. One of the main attractions of the Oval pop-up for many families is the affordability. The whole of the park and its dozens of activities - from workouts during the weekdays to movie nights on Fridays and concerts on the weekends - are free.</p>

			<h3>Awards</h3>
			<p>The American Planning Association presented The Oval with an award in recognition of its designation as one of their 2015 Great Places in Pennsylvania in the category of Great Public Spaces! Mark Focht and Marc Wilken from Philadelphia Parks and Recreation accepted the award on behalf of PPR and the Fairmount Park Conservancy.</p>
